# About

Many office workers struggle to quickly and accurately put their thoughts down on paper. This can lead to frustration,
delays, and a lack of productivity. To assist these workers, I plan to develop an application that enables them to type
as fast as they think.

The application will focus on developing typing skills aimed at speed and accuracy, with the aim of enabling users to
quickly and efficiently put their thoughts down on paper.
The program will also utilize advanced algorithms to assist the user in developing an intuitive typing style. This means
that the user will not only be able to type quickly, but also without having to consciously think about the act of
typing itself.

By using this application, office workers can significantly reduce their typing time and increase their productivity.
Moreover, it can enable them to document complex ideas and thoughts quickly and accurately, contributing to better
communication and collaboration within the team.
The ultimate goal is to enable office workers to type as fast as they think, freeing up more time for them to
concentrate on the substance of their work and less time on typing. This will enable them to get more done in less time
and enjoy more time off.

## Features

- minimalistic design
- typing test
- live errors
- account system

## Introduction

The application will focus on developing typing skills focused on speed and accuracy, with the aim of enabling users to
quickly and efficiently put their thoughts on paper. The program will also use advanced algorithms to help the user
develop an intuitive typing style. This means that the user can not only type quickly but also type without consciously
thinking about the act of typing itself.

The main element of the application is the typing test itself. When you run the application, you will automatically
arrive there.

## Requirements

- To run this web application, you need an IDE such as Webstorm or Visual Studio Code to compile the code.
- No API Keys are required to run this application.
- No backend data is required for this application.
- You can create an account directly.
- Account information will be saved for 24 hours.

## Installation steps

There are two ways to install the application:

1. Download the application

* Via a zip file
* Via an SSH link

2. Install the dependencies
3. Start the application

#### 1. Installing via a Zip

1. Go to GitHub and click on <> Code to download the zip file.
2. After downloading the zip file, you need to extract the file. Navigate to the file and right-click on it, then click
   on
   Extract All.
3. Once you have extracted the file, you can go to your IDE of choice. In this example, we will be using the Jet Brains
   IDE, called WebStorm. When you open the IDE, go to Projects/Open.
4. Then navigate to the extracted file, click on the folder where everything is located, and click OK.
   Proceed to step 2.

#### 1. Installing via a Git link

1. Go to GitHub and click on <> Code and copy the SSH link.
2. Once you have done this, you can go directly to your IDE of choice. In this example, we will be using the Jet Brains
3. IDE, called WebStorm. When you open the IDE, go to Projects/Get from VCS.
4. Then paste the link you copied into the URL bar and click on Open.

#### 2. Installing the dependencies

1. Now that the application is ready on your local computer, we can provide the necessary dependencies for the
   application.
2. On the left side, you will see the folder structure. Look for the file package.json and right-click on it. At the
3. bottom, you will see Run "npm install," click on it.
4. Installation may take a few minutes. This gives you time to grab a cup of tea or coffee.
5. If the IDE is finished installing dependencies, you may encounter error messages in the terminal.
6. This problem cannot be resolved because it depends on the creators of the dependencies. Fortunately, it is safe to
   run
   your application in this way.
7. If there are more error messages, you can execute "npm audit fix" or "npm audit fix -- force" in the terminal.

#### 3. Start the application

1. After installation, we will start the application. You do this by right-clicking on the parent folder of package.json
   and going to "open in/terminal" in the menu. In the terminal, type "npm start." The browser will then open, allowing
   you
   to use the application.
2. When you want to stop the application, go back to the terminal and press ctrl + c. You will be asked if you want to
   stop
   the batch job (Y/N). Press Y + enter.

#### Accounts

There are no predefined accounts for the application. Fortunately, you can easily create an account yourself. You can do
this via Login (top right of the screen). In the login block at the bottom, you will see "Don't have an account? Sign up
here." Click on Sign Up and fill in your
details. You will then be redirected to the login screen where you can log in. After logging in, you can enjoy typing on
the
keyboard and setting high scores.
